rsconnectOptions: Package Options

#### Description

The rsconnect package supports several options that control the method used for http communications, the printing of diagnostic information for http requests, and the launching of an external
browser after deployment.

#### Details
Supported global options include:
rsconnect.ca.bundle Path to a custom bundle of Certificate Authority root certificates to use when connecting to servers via SSL. This option can also be specied in the environment variable RSCONNECT_CA_BUNDLE. Leave undefined to use your system’s default certificate store.
rsconnect.check.certificate Whether to check the SSL certificate when connecting to a remote host; defaults to TRUE. Setting to FALSE is insecure, but will allow you to connect to hosts
using invalid certificates as a last resort.
rsconnect.http Http implementation used for connections to the back-end service:
rcurl
curl
internal
Secure https using the RCurl package
Secure https using the curl system utility
Insecure http using raw sockets
If no option is specified then rcurl is used by default.
* ``rsconnect.http.trace``: When TRUE, trace http calls (prints the method, path, and total milliseconds for each http request)
* ``rsconnect.http.trace.json``: When TRUE, trace JSON content (shows JSON payloads sent to and received from the server))
* ``rsconnect.http.verbose``: When TRUE, print verbose output for http connections (useful only for debugging SSL certificate or http connection problems)
* ``rsconnect.rcurl.options``: A named list of additional cURL options to use when using the RCurl HTTP implementation. Run ``RCurl::getCurlOptionTypes()`` to see available options.
* ``rsconnect.error.trace``: When TRUE, print detailed stack traces for errors occurring during deployment.
* ``rsconnect.launch.browser``: When TRUE, automatically launch a browser to view applications after they are deployed
* ``rsconnect.locale.cache``: When FALSE, disable the detected locale cache (Windows only).
* ``rsconnect.locale``: Override the detected locale.rsconnect.options
* ``rsconnect.max.bundle.size``: The maximum size, in bytes, for deployed content. If not set, defaults to 3 GB.
* ``rsconnect.max.bundle.files``: The maximum number of files to deploy. If not set, defaults to 10,000.
* ``rsconnect.force.update.apps``: When TRUE, bypasses the prompt to confirm whether you wish to update previously-deployed content
* ``rsconnect.pre.deploy``: A function to run prior to deploying content; it receives as an argument the path to the content that’s about to be deployed.
* ``rsconnect.post.deploy``: A function to run after successfully deploying content; it receives as an argument the path to the content that was just deployed.
When deploying content from the RStudio IDE, the rsconnect package’s deployment methods are executed in a vanilla R session that doesn’t execute startup scripts. This can make it challenging
to ensure options are set properly prior to push-button deployment, so the rsconnect package has a parallel set of “startup” scripts it runs prior to deploying. The follow are run in order, if they exist,prior to deployment:
$R_HOME/etc/rsconnect.site Like Rprofile.site; for site-wide pre-flight and options.
~/.rsconnect_profile Like .Rprofile; for user-specific content.
$PROJECT/.rsconnect_profile Like .Rprofile for projects; $PROJECT here refers to the root directory of the content being deployed.
Note that, unlike .Rprofile, these files don’t replace each other; all three will be run if they exist.

#### Examples
```{r}

## Not run:
# use curl for http connections
options(rsconnect.http = "curl")
# trace http requests
options(rsconnect.http.trace = TRUE)
# print verbose output for http requests
options(rsconnect.http.verbose = TRUE)
# print JSON content
options(rsconnect.http.trace.json = TRUE)
# don't automatically launch a browser after deployment
options(rsconnect.launch.browser = FALSE)
## End(Not run)
