Detect Application Dependencies

#### Description

Recursively detect all package dependencies for an application. This function parses all .R files in the application directory to determine what packages the application depends on; and for each of those packages what other packages they depend on.

#### Usage
<pre><code>

appDependencies(appDir = getwd(), appFiles = NULL)

</code></pre>
#### Arguments

* ``appDir``: Directory containing application. Defaults to current working directory.
* ``appFiles``:  The files and directories and deploy (only if upload = TRUE). Can be NULL, in which case all the files in the directory containing the application are bundled. Takes precedence over appFileManifest if both are supplied.




#### Examples
```{r}

# dependencies for the app in the current working dir
appDependencies()

# dependencies for an app in another directory
appDependencies("~/projects/shiny/app1")

```

#### Details
Dependencies are determined by parsing application source code and looking for calls to library,
require, ::, and :::.
Recursive dependencies are detected by examining the Depends, Imports, and ``LinkingTo`` fields of the packages immediately dependend on by the application.

#### Value
Returns a data frame listing the package dependencies detected for the application:
package
version
Name of package
Version of package

#### Note
Since the Suggests field is not included when determining recursive dependencies of packages, itâ€™s possible that not every package required to run your application will be detected.
In this case, you can force a package to be included dependency by inserting call(s) to require within your source directory. This code need not actually execute, for example you could create a standalone file named dependencies.R with the following code:

<pre><code>
require(xts)
require(colorspace)
</code></pre>
This will force the xts and colorspace packages to be installed along with the rest of your appli-
cation when it is deployed.
