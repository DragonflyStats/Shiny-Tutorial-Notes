##``shinyhelper`` 

shinyhelper.

#### Description 

Easily add markdown helpﬁles to your shiny apps, by adding a single function around a shiny app element. 
This adds a small icon (a question mark, by default) which presents content in a modal dialog box when clicked. 
The content can be passed inline or given in a markdown ﬁle.

#### Details 

* There is also a convenient function to initialise a directory of markdown ﬁles given a vector of ﬁlenames. 
* A demo is available at https://cwthom94.shinyapps.io/shinyhelper-demo/ 
* For further reference on how to use the package, please refer to https://github.com/cwthom/ shinyhelper
